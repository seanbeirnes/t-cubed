# t³ — Neural Network Tic-Tac-Toe AI

A neural network implementation for Tic-Tac-Toe AI written in Golang.

## Overview

**t-cubed** uses a feedforward neural network (FFNN) to choose optimal Tic-Tac-Toe moves through an efficient bitboard representation. The project demonstrates fundamental machine learning concepts in a simple, understandable game environment.

## Features

- **Bitboard Representation**: Efficient 9-bit encoding for each player's moves
- **Feedforward Neural Network**: 18-input, 9-output architecture for move prediction
- **Training Pipeline**: Generate and train on optimal game positions using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning

## How It Works

### Bitboard Encoding
Each player's moves are stored as a 9-bit segment of a 16-bit integer, where each bit represents a board position:
```
Position mapping:
0 | 1 | 2
---------
3 | 4 | 5
---------
6 | 7 | 8
```

**Why bit boards?**
In just **32 bits**, we can store the full game state and find open spaces through bitwise operations. In comparison, an array of 9 bytes would take **72 bits**.

### Neural Network Architecture
- **Input Layer**: 18 neurons (9 for Player 1, 9 for Player 2)
- **Hidden Layer(s)**: Configurable (default: 1-2 layers with 18-36 neurons)
- **Output Layer**: 9 neurons (confidence score for each possible move)

### Move Selection
The network outputs confidence scores for each position. The AI selects the highest-scoring legal move.

### Training Data Generation

Training examples are generated by running the minimax algorithm (with alpha-beta pruning) on all possible board states. For each state, the optimal move is determined and used as the target output for the neural network. This allows the network to learn from perfect play and generalize to unseen positions.

- **Input:** 18 floats (9 for Player 1’s bitboard, 9 for Player 2’s bitboard)
- **Output:** 9 floats (1.0 for the optimal move, 0.0 for others)
